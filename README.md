# GalleryApp

This markdown document outlines a Swift project that allows users to import photos from their photo album, sort them into different albums, create galleries, and organize them using a collection view or by sorting them based on different attributes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create an album management application that provides users with the ability to import photos from their device's photo album, categorize them into albums and galleries, and organize them using various sorting options. The application will leverage Swift and its UIKit framework to implement the user interface and handle photo management functionalities.

## Features

1. **Photo Import**: Users should be able to import photos from their device's photo album into the application.

2. **Album Creation**: Users should be able to create new albums to categorize their photos. Each album should have a unique name and contain a collection of photos.

3. **Gallery Creation**: Users should be able to create galleries to group related albums together. Galleries can be used to organize albums based on themes, events, or any other criteria.

4. **Photo Sorting**: Users should have the ability to sort photos within an album based on different attributes such as date, name, size, etc.

5. **Photo Movement**: Users should be able to freely organize their photos within an album using a collection view. This should allow them to rearrange the order of photos by moving them around.

## Project Structure

The project is organized around the following user-facing features:

1. **Photo Import**: This feature enables users to import photos from their device's photo album into the application.

2. **Album Creation**: Users can create new albums to categorize their photos. Each album has a unique name and can contain a collection of photos.

3. **Gallery Creation**: Users have the ability to create galleries to group related albums together. Galleries can be used to organize albums based on themes, events, or any other criteria.

4. **Photo Sorting**: Users can sort photos within an album based on different attributes such as date, name, size, etc. This allows for easy organization and retrieval of photos.

5. **Photo Movement**: Users can freely organize their photos within an album using a collection view. This feature allows them to rearrange the order of photos by moving them around, providing a customizable and personalized photo organization experience.

## Technologies

The project will leverage the following technologies and frameworks for its implementation:

- Swift: The primary programming language for developing the application.

- UIKit: A framework for building user interfaces in Swift, providing the necessary components for creating views, handling user interactions, and managing the application's layout.

- Photos Framework: A framework that allows access to the user's photo albums and provides APIs for importing and managing photos.

- UICollectionView: A view class provided by UIKit that displays an ordered collection of data items using customizable layouts.

- RxSwift: A reactive programming framework for Swift, utilized within the source code to enable reactive programming techniques such as asynchronous operations, event handling, and data binding.

By utilizing these technologies, the application can deliver a user-friendly interface, efficient photo management capabilities, and enhanced flexibility in handling asynchronous operations and event-driven programming within the source code.
